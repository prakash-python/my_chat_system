# my_chat_system

This project is a complete real-time chat system built using Django, Django REST Framework, JWT authentication, and Django Channels. It is developed step-by-step to help understand how modern chat applications work by first creating a full user system with a custom user model and JWT-based login, then implementing a REST-based chat module with chat rooms and messages, and finally upgrading it to a real-time WebSocket communication system using Django Channels and Redis. The project includes features like one-to-one chat rooms, message storage, last message previews, seen/unseen message tracking, and user online/offline status. It demonstrates the entire workflow of moving from simple API-based chat communication to a fully real-time system powered by asynchronous consumers and channel layers, making it an ideal learning path for understanding Django Channels in a practical way.
